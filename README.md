## 📚 Welcome to My DSA Repository  

This repository contains my **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** practice codes and notes.  
You are free to explore, learn, and take inspiration — but please **make your own clone** and try to implement the concepts by yourself. 💡  

---

## ✨ Features
- 📖 Organized DSA topics (Arrays, Linked Lists, Trees, Graphs, etc.)
- 📝 Well-structured code examples
- ⚡ Helpful for beginners and revision
- 🔗 Easy-to-navigate repository

---

## ⚙️ How to Use
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/dsa-repo.git

**📌 Note**

This repo is mainly for learning and revision purposes.

👉 Always try solving problems yourself first before looking at the solution.


**🤝 Contribution** 

Feel free to open issues, suggest improvements, or contribute with pull requests.

Let’s grow and learn DSA together! 🚀


#### Do you want me to also **add a structured DSA roadmap section** (like Arrays ➝ Strings ➝ Linked List ➝ Trees, etc.) inside the README so visitors can directly see your learning path?
